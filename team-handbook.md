# Sovryn Team Handbook

## Welcome to Sovryn!

Sovryn's purpose is to create an open, fair, and transparent financial system for the world. This is a big challenge and we're excited for you to help!

We put this handbook together to make it as easy as possible for new team members such as yourself to find your way around, spending less time figuring out how things work and more time on the things that really matter.

### Discord

Discord is the main Sovryn communication space. There are a lot of channels in Discord! But don't worry, you don't have to monitor all of them. Here are some suggestions for channels you _should_ check, and how often you should check if you see the name lit up (indicating there's been messages since you last checked):

- Your Circle's channel: at least once per day
- The channel of a project your are working on: a few times per day
- #circle-of-circles: at least once per day
- #announcements: at least once per day
- #bitocracy: once every few days

You should consider every other channel optional to check, unless you've got a notification because of a direct/everyone/here/role mention.

Speaking of notifications...

#### Managing Discord notifications

Discord has a great notification system, in that they allow highly-granular control of what kind of notifications you receive. However, by default, Discord can be quite noisy, with a lot of notifications and sounds that are likely irrelevant to you. You can instead start from a baseline of only receiving the bare minimum essential notifications, and then fine-tune from there. Here's how:

- First you need to know there are four levels at which you can adjust your notifications:
    - User settings (the gear next to your profile picture at the bottom of the app)
    - Server settings (right-click on the server icon in the sidebar)
    - Category (channel groups) settings
    - Individual channel settings (click on the gear inside of a channel)

- In your user settings, turn off all sounds except for incoming/outgoing calls, to start

- In your server settings, change notification settings to "only mentions"
-   In servers you don't feel obligated to participate in, you should also suppress "everyone/here" and "role" mentions

- Inside each server you're a part of, mute channel categories and individual channels that you never plan to check. This way you can minimize that category and save space in your channel list.

If you follow all of the above suggestions, then you will be left only with notifications for DMs and mentions in channels/servers you haven't muted. Now you need to figure out how to manage these incoming communications. You could look at the message ~immediately if it's from someone you recognize, unless you're in deep work, then you should check later on when you come out of your deep work time. During deep work time you could even close the Discord app to minimize distractions. Once you've looked at your messages, you need to either:
1) Prioritize the order and when you will reply, then reply,
2) Delegate the reply (send the message sender to someone else or ask someone else to follow up with them), or
3) Ignore the message (don't respond at all, and if spam, report and block)

Following these tips should greatly enhance your experience and productivity in Discord :)

## Recurring calls

There are several recurring calls in Sovryn that you should be aware of, both so you can join them if you want to and to avoid major conflicts when you're scheduling a call of your own.
